# Redux Feedback Survey

## Description

_Duration: 3 Day Sprint_

This application is a multi-part feedback or reflection form for users to provide ratings of how well they are feeling, understanding the content and being supported. The user can leave additional comments, concerns, or compliments, which is optional, while also being able to go back and change responses. The application closes with a review prior to submitting survey. Additionally, there is an admin page which renders the survey response data populated to a table. This admin page is intended to be accessed only by the survey administrator. Feel free to take this app for a spin, or fork it and attempt to build one for yourself!


To see the fully functional site, please visit: [DEPLOYED VERSION OF APP](www.heroku.com)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database, name it whatever you'd like, _NOTE:_ if not deployed, your db name should be changed in `pool.js`
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico 2 to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Fork and clone the repo: [GitHub](https://github.com/heidicodes/weekend-redux-feedback-loop)
3. Open up your text editor and run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. The `cmd + t` command will open up a new terminal tab for you...
6. Then run `npm run client` in your terminal
